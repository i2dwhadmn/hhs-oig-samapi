We also reviewed the\\nPerformance Summary Report, which includes management\\'s assertions and related performance\\ninformation for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Lastly, we reviewed the Budget\\nFormulation Compliance Report, which includes budget formulation information for the fiscal\\nyear ending September 30, 2022¹, and the Chief Financial Officer\\'s or accountable senior\\nexecutive\\'s assertions relating to the budget formulation information. CDC management is\\nresponsible for, and submitted, the Detailed Accounting Report, Performance Summary Report,\\nand Budget Formulation Compliance Report, which were prepared in accordance with the\\nONDCP Circular National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews, dated\\nOctober 22, 2019 (ONDCP Compliance Reviews Circular). It is our responsibility to express a\\nconclusion about the reliability of management\\'s assertions based on our review.\\nWe performed this review as required by 21 U.S.C. § 1704(d)(1) and as authorized by 21 U.S.C.\\n§ 1703(d)(7) and in compliance with the ONDCP Compliance Reviews Circular.\\n1 Although CDC\\'s Budget Performance Compliance Report was provided to ONDCP as of FY20, the budget figures\\nreflect the FY22 funding request.\\n\\nPage 2- Debra Houry, MD, MPH; Christa Capozzola\\nWe conducted our review in accordance with attestation standards established by the American\\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants and the standards applicable to attestation engagements,\\nas described in the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) publication, Government\\nAuditing Standards (July 2018). Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to\\nobtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to\\nmanagement\\'s assertions to be in accordance with the criteria. A review is substantially less in\\nscope than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance and express\\nan opinion about whether management\\'s assertions are in accordance with the criteria in all\\nmaterial respects. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. We believe that our review\\nprovides a reasonable basis for our conclusion.\\nBased on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to\\nCDC\\'s Detailed Accounting Report and Performance Summary Report for fiscal year 2020 and\\nCDC\\'s Budget Formulation Compliance Report for fiscal year 2022 for them to be in accordance\\nwith the ONDCP Compliance Reviews Circular.\\nCDC\\'s Detailed Accounting Report, Performance Summary Report, and Budget Formulation\\nCompliance Report assertions² are included as Attachments A, B, and C, respectively.\\nAlthough this report is an unrestricted public document, the information it contains is intended\\nsolely for the information and use of Congress, ONDCP, and CDC. It is not intended\\nto be, and should not be, used by anyone other than those specified parties.

The baseline using 2015 was generated using the 29 PfS states as the denominator and the 2016 Actual\\nand Target Measures for outlying years were calculated using the 29 PfS states, as opposed to the 5 states used in\\nyears prior.\\n3\\nA new baseline and subsequent years\\' targets were calculated using a broader drug overdose death category to\\nbetter represent the opioids recently associated with drug overdose mortality (including prescription, heroin, and\\nsynthetic other than methadone) in recognition of the evolving nature of the opioid overdose epidemic in the United\\nStates.\\n4 CDC will replace measure because the overdose death data do not distinguish between discrete types of opioids,\\nusing a measure that does will better guide prevention activities.\\nNew measure: Reduce the age-adjusted annual rate of overdose deaths involving natural and\\nsemisynthetic opioids (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone) or methadone as a contributing cause of\\ndeath among states funded through CDC\\'s multi-state surveillance and prevention cooperative\\nagreement (per 100,000 residents)\\n2017 Historical\\n2018 Historical\\n2019 Historical\\n2020 Target\\n2021 Target\\nActual\\nActual\\nActual\\n4.40 per 100,000\\n4.9 per 100,000\\nTBD\\n3.91 per 100,000\\n3.74 per\\nresidents\\nresidents\\nresidents\\n100,000\\nresidents\\nNew measure: Reduce age-adjusted annual rate of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids\\nother than methadone (e.g., fentanyl) among states funded through CDC\\'s multi-state\\nsurveillance and prevention cooperative agreement (per 100,00 residents)\\n2017 Historical\\n2018 Historical\\n2019 Historical\\n2020 Target\\n2021 Target\\nActual\\nActual\\nActual\\n9.0 per 100,000\\n11.2 per 100,000\\nTBD\\n7.99 per 100,000\\n7.65 per\\nresidents\\nresidents\\nresidents\\n100,000\\nresidents\\nPerformance Measures-The report must describe the performance measures used by the\\nagency to assess the National Drug Control Program activities it carried out in the most\\nrecently completed fiscal year and provide a clear justification for why those measures are\\n\\nATTACHMENT B\\nPage 4 of 6\\nappropriate for the associated National Drug Control Program activities. The performance\\nreport must explain how the measures: clearly reflect the purpose and activities of the\\nagency; enable assessment of agency contribution to the National Drug Control Strategy;\\nare outcome-oriented; and are used in agency management. The description must include\\nsufficient detail to permit non-experts to understand what is being measured and why it is\\nrelevant to those activities.\\nCDC has been tracking the rise of opioid overdose deaths and using the data to inform\\nprevention activities to curb this alarming epidemic. Over 450,000 people have died from\\noverdoses involving opioids - prescription or illicit in the United States from 1999 through 2018.\\nIn response to this growing public health crisis, CDC launched its Overdose Prevention in States\\n(OPIS) effort in FY 2016 as means to equip states with resources and expertise needed to reverse\\nthis epidemic. As a part of OPIS, CDC\\'s Prescription Drug Overdose Prevention for States (PfS)\\nprogram funded 29 state health departments to advance and evaluate comprehensive state-level\\ninterventions for preventing opioid-related overdose, misuse, and abuse.\\nCDC has tailored its response as the epidemic continues to evolve. In FY 2019, CDC released its\\nnew Notice of Funding Opportunity, Overdose Data to Action (OD2A). This program funds 47\\nstates, Washington, D.C., 16 localities, and two territories to advance the understanding of the\\nopioid overdose epidemic and to scale-up prevention and response activities which builds on\\nprevious surveillance efforts to foster an interdisciplinary, comprehensive and cohesive public\\nhealth approach to the complex and changing nature of the opioid overdose epidemic. In FY\\n2022, CDC will continue to support recipients along the trajectory of moving from data to action,\\nbuilding upon work completed through OD2A.\\nCurrently, CDC is measuring progress in reducing overdose deaths involving all opioids among\\nthe states funded specifically for PfS for the award made in FY 2016. CDC updated its measures\\nto ensure that the denominators adequately capture states funded through CDC\\'s multi-state\\nsurveillance and prevention cooperative agreement. Since 2016, as the epidemic has evolved,\\nCDC has scaled its programs from an initial cohort of states to a program with a national scope.\\nThe updated language allows CDC to consistently report outcomes based on the denominator of\\nfunded states. For FY 2022, CDC\\'s measure of natural and semi-synthetic opioid overdose\\ndeaths was replaced with a new measure that captures methadone and thus better captures\\noverdoses related to prescription opioids. This update allows CDC to better guide prevention\\nactivities related to safer prescribing. In FY 2018, the age-adjusted annual rate of opioid deaths\\ninvolving prescription opioids was 4.9 per 100,000 residents among states funded for the PfS\\nprogram.\\nPrior Years Performance Targets and Results-For each performance measure, the report\\nmust provide actual performance information for the previous four fiscal years and\\ncompare the results of the most recently completed fiscal year with the projected (target)\\nlevels of performance established for the measures in the agency\\'s annual performance\\nbudget for that year. If any performance target for the most recently completed fiscal year\\nwas not met, the report must explain why that target was not met and describe the agency\\'s\\nplans and schedules for meeting future targets. Alternatively, if the agency has concluded\\n\\nATTACHMENT B\\nPage 5 of 6\\nit is not possible to achieve the established target with available resources, the report\\nshould include recommendations concerning revising or eliminating the target.\\nSee charts above for targets and actuals. CDC did not meet its most recent (FY18) target to\\nreduce the age-adjusted annual rate of overdose deaths involving opioids per 100,000 population\\namong the states funded through Prescription Drug Overdose: Prevention for States (PfS)\\nprogram. We believe this is related to the growing issue of polysubstance use which means that\\nan opioid-involved overdose often occurs in combination with exposure to other opioids and/or\\nother non-opioid substances. Some examples of polysubstance exposures found in combination\\nin overdose deaths include: illicitly-manufactured fentanyl (IMF) and heroin; illicitly-\\nmanufactured fentanyl and cocaine; heroin and methamphetamine; and prescription or illicit\\nopioids and benzodiazepines. The overdose epidemic has grown increasingly complex by co-\\ninvolvement of prescription and illicit drugs. For example, synthetic opioids (primarily IMF)\\nwere involved in 23.7% of deaths involving prescription opioids, 37.4% involving heroin, and\\n40.3% involving cocaine.\\nCDC will continue to strengthen surveillance activities, identify interventions, and implement\\nprevention programs that address the evolving nature of the epidemic. In an example of the\\nsuccess of CDC\\'s current opioid programs, the Forest County Potawatomi Community in\\nWisconsin created a media campaign targeting the stigma associated with opioid use disorder\\nwithin Native American culture. In collaboration with the Tribe\\'s Executive Council, the\\ncampaign kick-off engaged community members, law enforcement, media, and over 90 tribal\\nyouth. The media campaign \"blitz\" featured a television ad running 62 times per week during\\npeak programming, and print media (billboards) displaying images of tribal members. Since the\\nlaunch of the campaign, Forest County Potawatomi Community has experienced no deaths by\\noverdose, as well as an increase in community members seeking inpatient treatment, medication-\\nassisted treatment, and residence in transitional living homes.\\nCDC has also replaced the measure because the overdose death data do not distinguish between\\ndiscrete types of opioids; using a measure that does will better guide prevention activities.\\nCurrent Year Performance Targets-Each report must specify the performance targets\\nestablished for National Drug Control Program activities in the agency\\'s performance\\nbudget for the current fiscal year and describe the methodology used to establish those\\ntargets.\\nSee target charts on first page of report. Targets were set based upon an understanding of\\nscientific findings and current and planned CDC-funded state-level activities to address and\\nprevent opioid overdoses.\\nQuality of Performance Data-The agency must state the procedures used to ensure that\\nthe performance data described in this report are accurate, complete, and unbiased in\\npresentation and substance. Agency performance measures must be supported by data\\nsources that are directly pertinent to the drug control activities being assessed and ideally\\nallow documentation of small but significant changes.\\nThese data are from CDC\\'s National Center for Health Statistics\\' National Vital Statistics\\nSystem (NVSS).

CK is a type of protein, known as an enzyme. It is mostly\\nfound in your skeletal muscles and heart, with lesser amounts in the brain. Skeletal muscles are the muscles attached to your\\nskeleton. They work with your bones to help you move and give your body power and strength. Heart muscles pump blood\\nin and out of the heart.\\nThere are three types of CK enzymes:\\nCK-MM, found mostly in skeletal muscles\\nCK-MB, found mostly in the heart muscle\\nCK-BB, found mostly in brain tissue\\nA small amount of CK in the blood is normal. Higher amounts can mean a health problem. Depending on the type and level\\nof\\nCK found, it can mean you have damage or disease of the skeletal muscles\\nhttps://medlineplus.gov/muscledisorders.html], heart, or brain.\\nOther names: CK, total CK, creatine phosphokinase, CPK\\nWhat is it used for?\\nA CK test is most often used to diagnose and monitor muscular injuries and diseases. These diseases include:\\nMuscular dystrophy [https://medlineplus.gov/musculardystrophy.html],a rare inherited disease that causes\\nweakness, breakdown, and loss of function of skeletal muscles. It mostly occurs in males.\\nRhabdomyolis, a rapid breakdown of muscle tissue. It can be caused by a serious injury, muscle disease, or other\\ndisorder.\\nThe test can be used to help diagnose a heart attack, though not very often. CK testing used to be a common test for heart\\nattacks [https://medlineplus.gov/heartattack.html] But another test, called troponin [https://medlineplus.gov/lab-\\ntests/troponin-test/], has been found to be better at detecting heart damage.\\nWhy do I need a CK test?\\nYou may need a CK test if you have symptoms of a muscular disorder. These include:\\nMuscle pain and/or cramps [https://medlineplus.gov/musclecramps.htm\\nMuscle weakness\\nBalance problems (https://medlineplus.gov/balanceproblems.html\\nNumbness or tingling\\nSource: MedlinePlus, National Library of Medicine.\\n\\nYou may also need this test if you had a muscle injury or stroke [https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html] CK levels may not\\npeak until up to two days after certain injuries, so you may need to be tested a few times. This test can help show if you have\\ndamage to your heart or other muscles.\\nWhat happens during a CK test?\\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is\\ninserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in\\nor out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\\nYou don't need any special preparations for a CK test.\\nAre there any risks to the test?\\nThere\\nis very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in,\\nbut most symptoms go away quickly.\\nWhat do the results mean?\\nIf your results show you have a higher than normal level of CK, it may mean you have an injury or disease of the muscles,\\nheart, or brain. To get more information, your provider may order tests to check the levels of specific CK enzymes:\\nIf you have higher than normal CK-MM enzymes, it may mean you have a muscle injury or disease, such as muscular\\ndystrophy or rhabdomyolis.\\nIf you have higher than normal CK-MB enzymes, it may mean you have an inflammation of the heart muscle or are\\nhaving or recently had a heart attack.\\nIf you have higher than normal CK-BB enzymes, it may mean you have had a stroke or brain injury.\\nOther conditions that can cause higher than normal CK levels include:\\nBlood clots [https://medlineplus.gov/bloodclots.html\\nInfections\\nHormonal disorders, including disorders of the thyroid Ittps://medlineplus.gov/thyroiddiseases.html] and adrenal\\nglands [https://medlineplus.gov/adrenalglanddisorders.html]\\nLengthy surgery\\nCertain medicines\\nStrenuous exercise\\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.\\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results [https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/how-to-\\nunderstand-your-lab-results/]\\nIs there anything else I need to know about a CK test?\\nOther blood tests, such as an electrolyte panel and kidney function tests [https://medlineplus.gov/kidneytests.html] may\\nbe ordered along with a CK test.\\nReferences\\n1.

The virus has been\\nnamed Severe Acute Respiratory Disease Coronavirus-2 (\"SARS-CoV-2\") and causes\\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\"). On January 30, 2020, the International Health\\nRegulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization (\"WHO\"), declared the\\noutbreak a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\". On January 31, the US\\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Secretary (\"HHS\"), Alex M. Azar II, declared a Public\\nHealth Emergency for the US to aid the nation\\'s healthcare community in responding to COVID-\\n19. On March 11, 2020, WHO publicly characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. On March 13,\\n2020 the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency.\\nThe Government has identified COVID-19 vaccine candidates that are progressing rapidly through\\nadvanced research and development activities.\\nTherefore, in response to a request by the Government, Pfizer is proposing to manufacture at-scale\\nand fill-finish, for provision to the Government, a state-of-the-art candidate vaccine, developed in\\ncollaboration with BioNTech and capable of providing protection against the SARS-CoV-2 threat\\nand related coronaviruses, subject to technical, clinical and regulatory success.\\nPfizer and BioNTech\\'s program aims to revolutionize the vaccine field by providing an mRNA\\ncandidate that, itself, has several key advantages, including the efficiency and flexibility of the\\nplatform - which is apparent by the pace of the vaccine development and the unprecedented phase\\n1\\nThis Statement of Work includes proprietary and confidential commercial data of Pfizer Inc. that shall not be disclosed outside the MCDC\\nManagement Firm and the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than to evaluate\\nthis Statement of Work and negotiate any subsequent award. If, however, an agreement is awarded as a result of, or in connection with, the\\nsubmission of this data, the MCDC Management Firm and the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose these data to the extent\\nprovided in the resulting agreement.

The collaboration leverages Pfizer\\'s\\nbroad expertise in vaccine research and development, regulatory capabilities, and global\\nmanufacturing and distribution network. The two companies are jointly conducting clinical trials,\\nand will also work jointly to commercialize the vaccine upon regulatory approval.\\nPfizer and BioNTech have already made substantial progress, outside this Statement of Work and\\nwithout use of any Government funding, towards the demonstration of technical and\\nmanufacturing feasibility, including through the initiation of Phase 1/2 studies evaluating the\\nlikelihood of safety, tolerability and immunogenicity in the US and in Germany. The goal of the\\nprogram is to rapidly develop and obtain regulatory licensure for a vaccine for use in adults >18\\nyears of age, followed by a possible pediatric and/ or maternal indication (to protect ~4M US\\npregnant women at risk each year). Both companies aspire to have an FDA-approved or authorized\\nvaccine ready for administration in the US by October 31, 2020. Based on current information,\\nPfizer and BioNTech anticipate a 2-dose per patient regimen.\\nThis Statement of Work is designed toward establishing production capacity and distribution\\ninfrastructure sufficient to ensure that doses of the vaccine manufactured under this Agreement\\ncan be made available immediately for administration in the US, if clinical trials are successful\\nand the FDA grants an Emergency Use Authorization (\"EUA\") under Section 564 of the Federal\\nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or Biologics License Application (\"BLA\") licensure under Section\\n351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (hereafter \"FDA-approved or authorized\").\\n1.1.2 ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT GOVERNMENT FUNDING\\nThis section describes activities that Pfizer and BioNTech have been performing and will continue\\nto perform without use of Government funding. These activities are described solely for\\nbackground and context for the Government-funded deliverables itemized in Section 4.\\nA.\\nRegulatory Planning\\nPfizer will meet the necessary FDA requirements for conducting ongoing and planned clinical\\ntrials, and with its collaboration partner, BioNTech, will seek FDA approval or authorization for\\nthe vaccine, assuming the clinical data supports such application for approval or authorization.\\nGiven that these clinical trials are regulated by the FDA and HHS, there is no need for separate\\nregulation by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command. BioNTech is the\\nInvestigational New Drug (\"IND\") holder, while Pfizer is the designated agent for all interactions\\nwith the FDA and is taking the lead on all communications with and submissions to FDA.\\n3\\nThis Statement of Work includes proprietary and confidential commercial data of Pfizer Inc. that shall not be disclosed outside the MCDC\\nManagement Firm and the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than to evaluate\\nthis Statement of Work and negotiate any subsequent award. If, however, an agreement is awarded as a result of, or in connection with, the\\nsubmission of this data, the MCDC Management Firm and the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose these data to the extent\\nprovided in the resulting agreement. This restriction does not limit the MCDC Management Firm and the Government\\'s right to use the information\\ncontained in these data if they are obtained from another source without restriction The data subject to this restriction are set forth on each page of\\nthis Statement of Work.\\nUS 168054648v17\\n\\nB.\\nClinical and Regulatory Approach\\nBioNTech is the regulatory sponsor for trials of the vaccine and will be the applicant in the US for\\nan EUA and/or a BLA, and will ultimately be the holder of any such approval issued in the US.\\nPfizer is BioNTech\\'s authorized agent to FDA. As noted above, Pfizer is the designated agent for\\nall interactions with the FDA and is taking the lead on all communications with and submissions\\nto FDA.\\nPrior to commencing clinical development, on February 6, 2020, BioNTech obtained feedback\\nfrom the Paul Ehrlich Institute (\"PEI\") on plans for rapid vaccine development in response to the\\nCOVID-19 outbreak following a Scientific Advice Meeting. Based on the PEI feedback,\\nBioNTech refined the clinical program plan and prepared a detailed protocol for FIH clinical study\\n(BNT162). Additionally, a meeting was held by BioNTech on February 24, 2020 with the Chinese\\nCDC to discuss a possible Special Review Procedure.\\nIn Germany, BioNTech began a Phase 1/2 study (BNT162-01) in late April 2020. BNT162-01 is\\na dose-escalation trial investigating the safety and immunogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine\\ncandidates in healthy adults. The primary objective of the study is to describe the safety and\\ntolerability profiles of prophylactic BNT162 vaccine candidates after a single dose (for saRNA)\\nor two doses separated by 21 days (uRNA and modRNA candidates). The secondary objective of\\nthe study is to describe the immune response to the vaccine in healthy adults, as measured by a\\nfunctional antibody assay, such as virus neutralization.\\nInformed by BNT162-01, the Phase 1/2 US study (C4591001) of the vaccine candidates started in\\nMay 2020. Pfizer and BioNTech utilized this approach to efficiently optimize formulation and\\ndose selection in the clinic. Study C4591001 is a single, multistage and multi-phase trial (including\\nthe pivotal efficacy portion) designed to generate the data needed to achieve FDA approval or\\nauthorization for use of one of the vaccine candidates. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled,\\nobserver-blind, dose-finding and vaccine candidate-selection study in healthy adults. The study is\\nevaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine\\ncandidates.\\nThe study consists of 3 stages:\\nStage 1: to identify preferred vaccine candidate(s), dose level(s), number of doses, and\\nschedule of administration (with the first 15 participants at each dose level of each vaccine\\ncandidate comprising a sentinel cohort);\\nStage 2: an expanded-cohort stage; and\\nStage 3: a final candidate/dose large-scale stage.\\n4\\nThis Statement of Work includes proprietary and confidential commercial data of Pfizer Inc. that shall not be disclosed outside the MCDC\\nManagement Firm and the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than to evaluate\\nthis Statement of Work and negotiate any subsequent award.

Therefore,\\nthe study would be converted to a single Phase 1/2/3 study. The pivotal study portion (i.e., Phase\\n2b/3) is expected to enroll up to ~30,000 subjects (1:1 randomized between vaccine and placebo).\\nUpon gathering adequate safety and immunogenicity/efficacy data in a sufficient number of\\nsubjects, Pfizer believes the vaccine candidate could, with FDA\\'s agreement, be administered\\nunder EUA.\\nAs background, Pfizer\\'s and BioNTech\\'s activities to ensure provision of vaccine on a timely\\nschedule may include the following discrete activities, depending on emerging data and regulatory\\nguidance.\\nActivity\\nSuccess Criteria\\nEstimated Timing\\nCandidate, dose, and regimen\\nDecision endorsed by Pfizer-BioNTech\\n(b) (4)\\nselection\\nJoint Steering Committee\\nPhase 2b/3 Study Start\\nRequires FDA (CBER) approval\\n(b) (4)\\nPhase 1/2/3 Demonstration of\\nAdequate efficacy and safety data\\n(b) (4)\\nimmunogenicity,\\nefficacy\\nsupports EUA application\\n(interim analysis) and safety\\nEUA Submission to Support\\nAcceptance of EUA submission\\n(b) (4)\\nUse in American Population\\nBLA Submission to Support\\nAgreement from FDA (CBER) that\\n(b) (4)\\nUse in American Population\\nproposed licensure package (preclinical,\\nclinical, CMC) is acceptable\\nEUA Issuance to Support Use\\nEUA issued\\n(b) (4)\\nin American Population\\nBLA Approval to Support Use\\nBLA approval\\n(b)(4)\\nin American Population\\nPost-Approval Commitments\\nAgreement with FDA\\n(b)(4)\\nAgreed\\n5\\nThis Statement of Work includes proprietary and confidential commercial data of Pfizer Inc. that shall not be disclosed outside the MCDC\\nManagement Firm and the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than to evaluate\\nthis Statement of Work and negotiate any subsequent award.

The criteria for successful Emergency Use Authorization\\n(EUA) are described in Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products and Related\\nAuthorities: Guidance for Industry and Other Stakeholders, January 2017; and Development and\\nLicensure of Vaccine to Prevent COVID-19: Guidance for Industry June 2020. The successful\\nprovision of these doses shall establish the effectiveness of a technology capable of potentially\\nproviding immediate and long-term solutions to coronavirus infections. While pre-clinical,\\nclinical, and chemistry/manufacturing/controls (CMC) activities are described in the Background\\nsection of this Statement of Work, the Parties acknowledge and agree that such activities not\\nrelated to the large-scale manufacturing demonstration are out-of-scope for this prototype project\\nas Pfizer and BioNTech have and will continue to fund these activities, without the use of\\nGovernment funding.\\n8\\nThis Statement of Work includes proprietary and confidential commercial data of Pfizer Inc. that shall not be disclosed outside the MCDC\\nManagement Firm and the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than to evaluate\\nthis Statement of Work and negotiate any subsequent award.

Success of the prototype project is\\ndefined as manufacture of 100M doses of Pfizer and BioNTech\\'s mRNA-based COVID-19\\nvaccine and, upon FDA-approval or authorization as described above, delivery of those doses in\\naccordance with Section 6.0.\\nThis effort constitutes a prototype project because it will be used to evaluate the technical\\nfeasibility of completion of the prototype project during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and\\nunprecedented threats to several components of the prototype project. In addition, this is a\\nprototype project because Pfizer will demonstrate and prove-out the at-scale, multi-lot proprietary\\nmanufacturing activities in order to assess the feasibility to support the necessary quantity of safe\\nand effective doses required for vaccination of the U.S. population and deliver those doses within\\nchallenging cold chain requirements in accordance with Section 6.0. Successful completion of the\\nprototype project will demonstrate Pfizer\\'s capability to (i) rapidly manufacture product, which\\ncan be further scaled-up to meet mutually agreed to surge requirements with limited advance\\nnotification and (ii) distribute large quantities of the FDA-approved or authorized drug product in\\naccordance with Section 6.0.

Electric fields induced in the tissue due to gradient-induced voltages\\nremained below the threshold for cardiac tissue stimulation in all cases.\\nConclusions: Simulation and experimental results indicate that patients with FRLs can be scanned\\nsafely at both 1.5 T and 3 T with majority of clinical pulse sequences.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nWith an aging population and the rising prevalence of cardiac disease, cardiovascular\\nimplantable electronic devices (CIEDs) are used more frequently. Today, there are more than\\n3 million Americans with CIEDs (1), and the number grows by 80,000 annually (2). It is\\nestimated that 50-75% of these patients may need MRI for cardiac or non-cardiac indications\\n(3), with many patients requiring repeated examination (4).\\n\\nSeveral studies have assessed safety of MRI in patients with CIED leads connected to\\nworking devices. Some patients, however, require procedures which lead to \"lead extraction\",\\nleaving fractions of the device in situ in which case the original safety studies of the intact\\ndevice are not applicable. For example, patients undergoing heart transplant usually have a\\nCIED in place, often with multiple leads in the vascular space (5). At the time of surgery the\\nphysician attempts to remove the device by cutting the leads and extracting the pulse\\ngenerator, (leaving behind an exposed metal contact). Complete lead removal, however, is\\nnot always possible especially when there is adhesion of leads to the vessel wall or significant\\ncalcification (5). This leaves a sizeable cohort of patients with fragmented retained leads\\n(FRLs) (6,7). MRI is needed in majority of these patients either for cardiac indications (e.g.,\\nrejection monitoring, perfusion assessment) or neurological and orthopedic exams. Today,\\nhowever, there is no consensus on safety of MRI in patients with retained cardiac leads.\\nAlthough MR-conditional CIEDs have been available since 2011, the conditional labeling of\\nthese devices applies only to the intact device and leads in their originally intended\\nconfiguration. As such, studies assessing MRI safety of pacemaker or ICD generators mostly\\nexclude patients with FRLs (8,9).\\nDue to lack of guidelines, the decision whether to perform MRI on a patient with a fragmented\\nretained lead falls upon the physician\\'s judgment, and is often based on her assessment of\\nrisk to benefit ratio. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive assessment of MRI\\nhazards in patients with FRLs in order to provide actionable information to clinicians\\nencountering such cases. We expanded our previous work which assessed SAR\\namplification around patient-derived FRL models in a single homogenous body model (10),\\nby performing a thorough search for the worst-case heating scenario in body models with 30\\nunique combination of permittivity and conductivity covering a range of low to high values\\nreported for biological tissues. Additionally, we included new FRL models with folded\\ntrajectories and double leads in close proximity as these topologies are shown to alter RF\\nheating (11). To provide action points for clinicians, a conservative estimation of CEM43 for\\ndifferent exposure times and B1+ values was provided along with thresholds of tissue thermal\\ndamage. We also performed experiments measuring RF heating around fragments of\\ncommercial CIED leads implanted in gel phantoms to gain additional confidence as to typical\\nlevel of RF heating around FRLs in vitro. Finally, we assessed other sources of MRI hazard\\nincluding the potential for unintended tissue stimulation.\\nMETHODS\\nSources of MRI hazard in patients with FRLs\\nThe technical specification ISO-TS 10974 describes known sources of potential hazardous\\ninteraction between MRI fields and an active implantable medical device (AIMD). These\\ninclude risk of gradient-induced and RF-induced device heating, potential harm due to\\ngradient-induced vibration, gradient-induced extrinsic potentials, and gradient-induced\\ndevice malfunction, as well as risks associated with Bo-inserted force and torque (12).\\nGradient-induced device heating is the result of time varying imaging gradient dB/dt inducing\\neddy currents on AIMD conductive surfaces such as enclosures, battery components and\\ncircuit traces. For AIMDs with extended leads that do not contain larger conductive surfaces,\\nthere is no known mechanism for MRI-induced eddy current heating to occur in the lead (ISO-\\nTS 10974:9). Therefore, this is not a source of concern in patients with FRLs.\\n\\nGradient-induced eddy currents also generate a time-varying magnetic moment that interacts\\nwith the static magnetic field (B0) causing vibration of conductive surfaces (and subsequently\\nthe device) which could lead to device malfunction (ISO-TS 10974:10). For same reasons\\nexplained above, this is not a source of concern in patients with fragmented retained leads.\\nFinally, the risks associated with lead traction and dislodgment due to Bo-inserted force and\\ntorque are negligible as CIED leads are composed of non-magnetic material. RF-induced\\nheating and gradient-induced extrinsic voltages are therefore the only potential sources of\\nMRI hazard in patients with FRLs.\\nRF heating\\nRF heating is due to the antenna effect, where the electric field of MRI transmit coil couples\\nwith conductive leads and amplifies the specific absorption rate (SAR) of radiofrequency\\nenergy in the tissue, usually occurring around the tip of an elongated implant (10,13-17).\\nTemperature rises up to AT =30°C have been reported at tips of abandoned cardiac leads in\\nphantom experiments at 1.5 T (18,19).\\nMRI RF heating of an elongated lead is known to be a resonance phenomenon, depending\\non lead\\'s length and the distribution of MRI electric field\\'s phase along lead\\'s trajectory\\n(13,20,21). We created clinically relevant FRL models based on medical images of 10\\nrepresentative patients, including trajectories with folds or multiple leads in close proximity\\nas they may alter RF heating (19,22-24).\\nAnother important factor influencing RF heating is the electrical property of the medium\\nsurrounding the lead (25-28). To determine the worst-case scenario, we performed numerical\\nsimulations with each FRL model registered to homogenous body models with 30 unique\\ncombinations of permittivity and conductivity covering a range of low to high values reported\\nfor biological tissues (0E[0.1,1 S/m, The rationale for using a homogenous body\\nmodel with varying electrical properties was based on a recent study that showed such model\\ncan predict the worst-case SAR generated in a heterogeneous body mode at a reduced\\ncomputational cost (29). Finally, the position of the lead within the MRI RF coil affects its RF\\nheating (30,31). Thus, RF heating was assessed for each FRL+ body model positioned inside\\nthe MRI body coil at landmarks corresponding to head, chest, and abdomen imaging.\\nTemperature rise in the tissue was conservatively estimated by solving the simplified Penne\\'s\\nbio-heat equation excluding cooling effects of the perfusion:\\nOT\\not\\nwhere T is the temperature, p is the density (1000 kg/m3), C is the specific heat capacity of\\nthe tissue (4150 Jkg-10C-1) and k is the isotropic thermal conductivity (0.42 W/m -1°C-1) (32).\\nFor each FRL model, thermal simulations were performed in the human body model that\\ngenerated the highest local SAR at the corresponding imaging landmark (abdomen, chest\\nand head), with the input power of coils adjusted to produce B1+ in a range of 1 T to 5 T.\\nThe selected B1+ values cover the whole range of routine clinical protocols including high-\\nSAR sequences.\\nTo provide actionable information, we calculated the worst-case cumulative equivalent\\nminutes at 43 °C (CEM43) for a range of exposure times (1-10 minutes) and B1+ values (1T-\\n\\n5 T) at 1.5 T and 3 T. CEM43 is currently the accepted metric for thermal dose assessment\\nthat correlates well with thermal damage in variety of tissues (33,34). The calculation of\\nCEM43 requires knowledge of thermal history as:\\nCEMA3=4txR(33-1)\\nwhere At indicates integration over the length of exposure, T is the average temperature\\nduring the exposure time, and R is a constant equal to 0.25 for T<43°C and 0.5 for T>43°C\\n(33). To be conservative, CEM43 was calculated using temperature rise AT from the FRL\\nmodel that generated the maximum heating. Finally, we performed experiments with\\nfragments of a commercial cardiac lead implanted in a gel phantom during RF exposure at\\n1.5 T and 3T to gain additional confidence as to level of RF heating observed in vitro.\\nGradient-induced voltage\\nExtrinsic electric field potentials are gradient-induced voltages that develop between spatially\\nseparated electrodes within a single lead or between electrodes of a multi-lead system (ISO-\\nTS 10974:13). If the FRL is in contact with the excitable tissue, these voltages could\\npotentially cause unintended stimulation. We assessed the possibility of unintended tissue\\nstimulation due to gradient-induced extrinsic potentials along FRLs based on a conservative\\nestimation of electric potentials developed along the length of FRL models as described in\\nISO-TS 10974:13. These voltage values were then used to calculate a conservative\\nestimation of electric field E induced in the tissue developed between the two ends of each\\nFRL and the potential for unintended tissue stimulation was assessed in the context of\\ncardiac stimulation thresholds (35,36).\\nPatient-derived FRL models\\nChest CT and X-ray images of 100 patients with a history of implanted cardiac devices who\\nhad been admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital between 2006 and 2018 were\\nobtained through a search of the Northwestern Universities\\' Enterprise Data Warehouse.\\nImages were inspected by a radiologist (AR) for the presence of FRLs. From patients\\nidentified with FRL, 10 patients who had both chest X-ray and CT images that clearly\\ndelineated FRL trajectory and topology were included in the study. Patient characteristics are\\ngiven in Table 1.\\nLead trajectories were semi-automatically segmented from CT images using Amira (Amira\\n5.3.3, FEI Inc.), by applying a thresholding algorithm based on an intensity histogram analysis\\nwhich extracted a preliminary mask of the hyper-dense lead from the CT image (Figure 1A).\\nLead centerlines were manually extracted and exported to a CAD tool (Rhino 3D, Robert\\nMcNeal and Associates, Seattle, WA) where 3D models of FRLs were constructed around\\nthem. CIED leads usually include individual coiled wires extending from the proximal to the\\ndistal end of the lead. The topology of these coiled wires changes during the extraction\\nprocess as the physician applies force to extract the lead due to surrounding adhesions. We\\nused X-ray images to reconstruct the details of the FRL structure, including the number of\\nmicro-loops and the variation in their pitch (Figure 1B-C). To correctly position the FRLs in\\nthe human body model, we created a triangulated surface of each patient\\'s ribcage from CT\\nimages, which was then used to align and co-register the FRL of that patient to the ANSYS\\nmulti-compartment human body model (37) (Figure 1D). Once the FRL was in its correct\\nposition, we merged different body tissues to create a homogenous body model, which was\\n\\nthen assigned to a range of different electrical conductivity (o = 0.1 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and\\n1 S/m) and permittivity (&r =40, 50, 60, 70 and 80) to cover all relevant biological values (38).\\nThis is reasonable, as a recent study has showed a homogeneous body model with\\nconductivities varied in a range of low to high values (0.01 S/m\\n1\\nS/m) can predict the\\nfull range of SAR variations predicted by a heterogeneous body model (29).\\nMRI RF coils\\nNumerical models of two high-pass birdcage body coils (620 mm length, 607 mm diameter)\\nwere implemented in ANSYS Electronic Desktop and tuned to their respective Larmor\\nfrequencies - 64 MHz (1.5 T) and 127 MHz (3 T). Each RF coil was composed of 16 rungs\\nconnected at each end to two end rings and shielded by an open cylinder (1220 mm length,\\n660 mm diameter). The coils and shields were made of copper and their dimensions were\\nchosen based on a typical clinical body coil. A quadrature excitation was implemented by\\nfeeding the coils at two ports on the bottom end-ring that were 90° apart in position and\\nphase. Coils were tuned by lumped capacitors distributed at the end-ring gaps (86.5 pF for\\n64 MHz and 17 pF for 127 MHz) and matched to 50 Q using a single capacitor at each port\\n(100 pF at 64 MHz and 45.6 pF at 127 MHz) in series with an ideal voltage source with a 50\\nO internal resistance.\\nSAR and thermal simulations\\nA total of 1800 numerical simulations were performed, with 10 realistic FRL models\\nincorporated in body models with 30 unique combination of electrical conductivity and\\npermittivity, positioned in 2 MRI body coils (1.5 T and 3 T) at 3 different imaging landmarks\\n(abdomen, chest, head). The maximum value of 1g-averaged SAR (referred to as\\nMaxSAR1g) was calculated inside a conformal cylindrical volume (diameter = 2 or 3 cm\\ndepending on the shape of the FRL) that surrounded the FRL as illustrated in Figure 2.\\nTo ensure good numerical convergence, the initial mesh was set such that the maximum\\nelement size was <2 mm on the FRL, <2 mm in the surrounding conformal region in which\\nMaxSAR1g was calculated, and <50 mm in the body. ANSYS HFSS was set to follow an\\nadaptive mesh scheme with successive refinement of the initial mesh between iterative\\npasses until the difference in magnitude of the S-parameters fell below a set threshold of\\n0.02. Total time taken for each simulation was from thirty minutes to two and half hours\\n(depending on the length and the shape of FRL) on a DELL server with 1.5 TB memory and\\n2 Gold 6140 CPUs each having 18 processing cores. Table 2 gives mesh statistics\\nfor a typical simulation.\\nThermal simulations were performed in the human body model that produced the highest\\nlocal SAR at each imaging landmark (abdomen, chest and head), with input power of coils\\nadjusted to produce a spatial mean of B1+ amplitude (i.e., complex magnitude of B1+ averaged\\nover an axial plane passing through iso-center of the coil, see Figure 2) in a range of 1 T to\\n5 T.\\nRF heating measurements\\nTo gain additional confidence as to typical values of RF heating occurring in the tissue\\nsurrounding FRLs, we performed phantom experiments with four FRL models reconstructed\\nfrom commercially available pacemaker leads (Medtronic 5076), with trajectories mimicking\\n\\nthose that generated highest temperature rise in simulations. Specifically, we reconstructed\\nFRL #6 which generated highest temperature rise at 1.5 T for all three landmarks, and FRL\\nmodels #4, #3 and #9 which generated highest temperature rise at 3 T at abdomen, chest\\nand head landmarks, respectively (see Figure 3).\\nExperiments were performed in a Siemens Aera 1.5 T scanner and a Siemens Prisma 3 T\\nscanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). FRL models were positioned inside a\\nhuman-shaped container filled with a gel (12 cm thick) prepared by mixing 10 g/L of\\nPolyacrylic Acid (PAA, Aldrich Chemical) and 1.32 g/L Sodium Chloride with distilled water.\\nThe anthropomorphic phantom was designed using segmentation of patient images as\\ndescribed in our previous work (27). Bulk conductivity and relative permittivity of the gel was\\nmeasured to be O = 0.46 S/m and Er = 87 using a dielectric probe kit (85070E, Agilent\\nTechnologies, Santa Clara, CA) and a network analyzer.\\nRF heating was measured for two scenarios. First, FRL models were positioned in a location\\nanalogous to the middle of the chest similar to what we observed in patient images, namely\\nposition P1 as illustrated in Figure 6A. Second, and to be more conservative, we also\\nmeasured temperature rise for FRL models in a high field exposure location, namely position\\nP2 in Figure 6A which was near the phantom wall. To find the location of maximum field\\nexposure, we performed experiments with a simple insulated copper wire (see Supporting\\nInformation Figure S6) which was orientated parallel to the phantom\\'s long walls at three\\ndifferent depths from the gel\\'s surface. The temperature profile showed a right-left asymmetry\\nin local E-field distribution, which was in agreement with the earlier findings (39). The highest\\ntemperature rise was occurred when the wire was located along the phantom\\'s left wall and\\n2 cm from the gel\\'s surface. This location was chosen as P2 to position the FRL at the\\nmaximum E field exposure. Two fluoroptic temperature probes (OSENSA, BC, Canada) were\\nsecured at both tips for all 4 FRL models. Temperature rise AT in the gel was recorded during\\n10 minutes of RF exposure using a high-SAR T1-turbo spin echo sequence (TE = 7.3 msec,\\nTR=814 msec, flip angle = 150° for 1.5 T scans and TE = 7.5 msec, TR = 1450 msec, flip\\nangle = 150° for 3 T scans). An additional temperature probe was also positioned inside the\\nphantom far from the implant position, to observe the background heating (Figure 6). The\\nsequence parameters were adjusted to generate the RMS B1+ of 2T in the phantom. Imaging\\nwas performed using scanner\\'s built-in body coil. For each FRL model, the phantom was\\npositioned alternately such that the abdomen/chest/heao of the phantom was at the coil\\'s\\niso-center. For all experiments, precise positioning of the FRLs inside the gel was ensured\\nby using the support pillars with adjustable height which were positioned on a gird fitted to\\nthe bottom surface of the anthropomorphic phantom. Figure 6A shows details of the\\nexperimental setup.\\nEstimation of gradient-Induced extrinsic voltages\\nTo obtain a conservative estimation of electric field induced in the tissue, we first calculated\\nthe injected Vemf along each FRL using the Tier 1 approach described in ISO-TS10974:13\\n(12). This approach is based on simulated values of electric fields induced on the surface of\\na cylinder of 20 cm radius by a dB/dt=100 T/s, and gives the most conservative estimation of\\nextrinsic voltages for leads with length < 63 cm. We then estimated the electric field E induced\\nin the tissue between the two ends of each FRL by dividing the Vemf by the distance between\\nthe end tips (see Supporting Information Figure S7). These values were compared against\\ncardiac stimulation (CS) thresholds provided in the literature (40-42).\\n\\nRESULTS\\nSAR distribution and maximum temperature rise in the tissue\\nFigure 3 gives MaxSAR1g values for each FRL model during RF exposure at 64 MHz\\n(1.5T) and 127 MH (3 T) and for the body model positioned at head, chest, and abdomen\\nlandmarks. At each imaging landmark, the input power of the coil was adjusted such that\\nthe spatial mean of B1+ amplitude was 2T at coil\\'s iso-center. Boxcars represent the\\nvariation of MaxSAR1g as a function of electrical properties (o and &r) of the body model.\\nAs it can be observed, the specific combination of tissue permittivity and conductivity that\\nproduced maximum SAR was different for each FRL model, emphasizing the\\ninterdependency of different factors affecting RF heating (24). Plots of variation of\\nMaxSAR1g as a function of conductivity and permittivity are given in the Supporting\\nInformation Figures S1-S5. In general, lower values of conductivity generated higher\\nSAR in most models, with the trend being substantially more pronounced at 3 T.\\nMaxSAR1g (mean + standard deviation) was 3.50+4.23 W/kg for the head imaging\\nlandmark, 11.34+14.20 W/kg for the chest imaging landmark and 3.20+6.56 W/kg for the\\nabdomen imaging landmark for RF exposure at 1.5 T (averaged over all body\\ncompositions and all lead models, n=300). MaxSAR1g was significantly higher at chest\\nimaging landmark compared to both head landmark and abdomen landmark (one-tail t-\\ntest, p-value<1E-04). There was no significant difference between MaxSAR1g at head\\nand abdomen landmarks (two-tail t-test, p-value=0.5).\\nAt 3T, MaxSAR1g was 11.79+14.52 W/kg for the head imaging landmark, 32.09+34.65\\nW/kg for the chest imaging landmark and 6.8317.92 W/kg for the abdomen imaging\\nlandmark (averaged over all body compositions and all lead models, n=300). MaxSAR1g\\nwas significantly higher at chest imaging landmark compared to both head landmark and\\nabdomen landmark (one-tail t-test, p-value<1E-04) MaxSAR1g at head landmark was\\nslightly higher MaxSAR1g at abdomen landmark (one-tail t-test, p-value=1E-04). At all\\nimaging landmarks, MaxSAR1g was significantly higher at 3 T compared to 1.5 T (one-\\ntail paired t-test, p-values<1E-04)\\nFigure 4 shows histograms of MaxSAR1g distribution at each field strength and for each\\nimaging landmark. An exponential probability density function (mean of ) was fitted to each\\ndistribution using the MATLAB and Statistics Toolbox Release 2019a (The MathWorks, Inc.,\\nNatick, Massachusettes). For each case, the model that created the most extreme data point\\non the SAR distribution was used for subsequent thermal analyses. From Figure 4, it can be\\nobserved that approach was conservative as >99% of cases generated SAR values below\\nthis limit.\\nThermal dose\\nThe temperature rise in the tissue after a 10-minute of continuous RF exposure at 1.5 T and\\n3 T is given in Supporting Information Tables S1 and S2, respectively. To be conservative,\\nthermal simulations were performed using the body model with electrical properties that\\ngenerated the highest MaxSAR1g.\\nAt each imaging landmark and for each B1+ value, we calculated CEM43 corresponding to the\\nFRL model that generated the highest RF heating (see Figure 5). A review of published data\\n\\non tissue damage due to thermal exposure can be found in (34). For muscle tissue,\\nCEM43>80 min has been reported to cause chronic damage, whereas 41 <CEM43<8 min was\\nassociated with acute but minor damages. From Figure 5 it can be observed that for B1+<\\n2T, RF exposure at both 1.5 T and 3 T generated CEM43 <40 at all imaging landmarks,\\nindicating no thermal damage for acquisition times (TA) <10 minutes.\\nIt should be noted, however, that calculated CEM43 values for continuous RF exposure are\\nhighly conservative as MRI sequences typically have duty cycles much below 100%. Table\\n3 give examples of typical clinical sequences for neuroimaging, cardiac imaging, and body\\nimaging with their corresponding B1+ and acquisition times. The sequence-specific CEM43\\ncalculated for the FRL model that generated the maximum SAR is also given. As it can be\\nobserved CEM43 remained well below 40 for all sequences, indicating no thermal damage.\\nExperimental measurements\\nFigure 6B gives the maximum AT recorded along the length of each FRL model at each\\nlandmark and field strength. Imaging at chest landmark produced highest heating at both 1.5\\nT and 3 T, consistent with simulation predictions. In addition, higher heating was observed at\\n3 T compared to 1.5 T for most of the cases, which is also consistent with the simulation\\nresults. The maximum AT at high field exposure position (P2) was 2.4 °C for FRL #3 during\\nMRI at 3 T and 2.1 °C for FRL #6 during MRI at 1.5 T. The corresponding values of maximum\\nheating for realistic position (P1) were 0.7 °C for 3 T and 0.6 °C for 1.5 T.\\nEstimated extrinsic voltages\\nTable 4 gives the values of gradient-induced extrinsic potentials calculated from Supporting\\nInformation Table S3 (based on table A.3 in ISO-TS10794) and a conservative estimation of\\ninduced E field in the tissue between the two ends of each FRL. The strength-duration\\nparameters estimated by Reilly (40) form the basis for the CS limit defined in the IEC 60601-\\n2-33 safety guidelines (35). With a rheobase of 6.2 V/m and a time constant of 3 ms, Reilly\\ncalculated the CS limit as:\\n6.2V/m\\nE\\n<\\n1 - exp ms\\nwhere Teff is the effective length of the stimulation, which in this case is the rise time of the\\ngradient pulse. Most clinical scanners have a gradient rise time of 0.1 ms, leading to E field\\nthreshold of 189 V/m. From Table 4, all induced E values remained below this threshold.\\nDiscussion and Conclusion\\nThere is a steady growth in the use of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) in the United\\nStates and globally. The trend is likely to continue with new indications for use and\\ntechnological advancements in device manufacturing (43,44). Despite the increasing need,\\nMRI is still largely inaccessible to patients with CIEDs because of safety hazards underscored\\nby several injuries reported worldwide (45-48). Although new generations of pacemakers and\\ndefibrillators have reduced safety risks associated with MRI static and gradient fields affecting\\ndevice function, tissue heating from the radiofrequency excitation fields remain a major issue.\\n\\nThis so-called \"antenna effect\" happens when the electric field of the MRI transmitter couples\\nwith implanted leads of the CIED, causing the specific absorption rate (SAR) of the RF energy\\nto significantly amplify at the implant\\'s tip. In vitro and in vivo studies report temperature rises\\nup to 20° C at the lead tip highlighting the significance of the issue (49,50).\\nEfforts to develop MRI-compatible CIEDs are recent, with newly approved devices allowing\\nconditional MRI of patients with intact cardiac leads at both 1.5 T and 3 T scanners. There\\nis, however, a sizeable cohort of patients with abandoned or retained leads for whom MRI\\nunder current labeling is an absolute contraindication, mostly because very little is known\\nabout the phenomenology of MRI-induced heating in the tissue in the presence of partially\\nextracted leads. The major challenge in quantifying implant-induced heating in this case is\\nthat the problem has a large parameter space with many variables that interact with each\\nother. This includes the frequency and geometry of MRI RF coil, the length, trajectory, and\\nstructure of the abandoned/retained lead, the imaging landmark, and the patient\\'s anatomy.\\nSuch complexity precludes the application of a systematic experimental approach to infer the\\nworst-case heating scenario. Numerical simulations on the other hand, provide an exquisite\\nmethodology for exploring thousands of variable combinations in a holistic manner, allowing\\nanalysis of parameter extremes outside the bounds of normal clinical practice. This work\\nprovides the first comprehensive simulation study of MRI hazards in patients with fragmented\\nretained leads (FRLs) with a focus on RF heating and unintended tissue stimulation. We\\nperformed a total of 1800 simulations with 10 patient-derived FRL models registered to body\\nmodels with a range of low to high relative permittivities (Er =40-80) and conductivities (o =\\n0.1 - 1 S/m), positioned in MRI RF coils tuned to 64 MHz and 127 MHz, and at different\\nimaging landmarks corresponding to head, chest, and abdomen imaging. In general, body\\nmodels with lower conductivity generated higher SAR around FRL models. The trend was\\nspecifically pronounced at 3 T, where the maximum of SAR1g was almost always generated\\nin the body model with O = 0.1 S/m (with the exception of FRL #2 and FRL #7 at chest\\nlandmark, where body model with o = 0.2 S/m and o = 0.6 S/m generated the maximum\\nSAR, respectively).\\nIn terms of imaging landmark, we found an agreement in both simulation and experiment\\nresults that chest landmark produced significantly higher SAR compared to head and\\nabdomen landmarks at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Specifically, at 1.5 T MaxSAR1g was ~4-folds\\nhigher during RF exposure at chest landmark compared to head and abdomen landmarks.\\nSimilarly, at 3 T, MaxSAR1g was ~3-folds and 5-folds higher at chest landmark compared to\\nhead and abdomen landmarks, respectively. This was predictable, considering that FRLs\\nwere almost exclusively located in the subclavian vein which would position them at the\\nlocation of maximum RF field for the coil iso-center at chest. The experimental measurements\\npredicted similar heating pattern in terms of variation in imaging landmarks and RF\\nfrequency. RF heating at both 1.5 T and 3 T MRI remained below 3 °C for all the FRL models\\nused in the measurement.\\nAlthough SAR has been used as a surrogate to assess risks of RF heating of implants,\\ntemperature rise in the tissue is the ultimate indicator of tissue damage. Here we used a\\nhighly conservative approach to calculate the temperature rise AT in the tissue around each\\nFRL model by (a) using the body model that generated the maximum SAR around each FRL\\nmodel, (b) eliminating cooling effects of perfusion from Penn\\'s bioheat equation, and (c)\\ncalculating the AT for a continuous RF exposure, despite the fact that almost all MRI\\nsequences have duty cycles well below 100%. Another level of conservatism was applied in\\ndetermination of CEM43, which was calculated using AT from the FRL model which produced\\n\\nthe maximum RF heating. RF exposure with B1*< 2T generated CEM43 <40 at all imaging\\nlandmarks indicating no thermal damage for acquisition times (TA) <10 minutes. It should be\\nnoted, however, that many clinical sequences with higher B14 are much shorter than 10\\nminutes, and thus, generate negligible CEM43. Finally, a highly conservative assessment of\\nelectric field induced in the tissue due to gradient-induced voltages induced along the length\\nof the FRLs suggested that the risk of unintended tissue stimulation was negligible.\\nAlthough MRI is currently contraindicated in patients with fragmented retained leads, recent\\nstudies that retrospectively analyzed available radiographic images and clinical records\\nfound no adverse effect associated with application of MRI in patients with FRLs (51). Our\\nwork provides theoretical and experimental evidence that MRI, under certain conditions,\\nnamely, for RMS B1+< 2T, may be performed safely in patients with FRLs and as such can\\nserve as a guideline for future applications. These findings suggest that in patients with\\nfragmented retained lead who their clinical management would be changed based on the\\ndiagnostic power of MRI, and there is no alternative to MRI such as CT imaging, MRI with\\ncaution may be performed without significant adverse effect, however, for routine use of MRI\\nin these patients, larger cohort of patients must be studied.\\nFinally, we would like to emphasize the difference between \"abandoned\" and \"retained\" leads.\\nAlthough the words are sometimes used interchangeably, they refer to substantially different\\nscenarios in terms of MRI RF heating. Abandoned leads are leads that are simply disconnected\\nfrom the CIED generator and left in the body. As such, their internal geometry and trajectory\\nremains intact which means conductive wire remain within the insulation with only the tip exposed\\nto the tissue. Retained leads on the other hand, are fragments of bare conductive wires (the\\ninsulation comes off during the extraction) that are left in the body after an attempt is made to\\nextract the lead. As RF heating of insulated leads is in general higher than RF heating of bare\\nleads the results of this study should not be generalized to assume safety of MRI in patients with\\nabandoned leads or any FRL lead that has insulation retained with it.\\nAcknowledgement\\nThis work was supported by NIH grant R03EB025344.\\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. Sunder Rajan from the FDA Office of Science and\\nEngineering Laboratories, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, for helpful\\ndiscussions and guidance.\\n\\nSupporting Information Table S1.
